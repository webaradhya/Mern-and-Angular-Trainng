		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
			Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! 
			As one or our members told us:Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
			I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.

			<li>Season Package: $95</li>
			<li>Patron Package: $200</li>
			<li>Single Speaker: $25</li>
